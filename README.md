## The game

Thank you for downloading!

CarEleven is a sumo car game, the goal is to take the other car off the arena. Only one can win!

## Gameplay

The players' cars have a shovel on the front to make easier the task of tossing off the other player. Also, after some time, the players will get
the ability to boost to make throwing the opponent off the stage easier. When a player gets the boost it will be indicated with a sound 
and the cars' wheels will turn green. Each player can boost three times before they run out of it, but they can also
obtain one aditional boost if they break a capsule that will appear in the arena every once in a while.
You need to have certain speed when boosting to make the force of the boost more efective.

Be careful with the rotating blades on the sides of the arena or they will toss you off.

Each player has three lives. The loser will be the one that loses their lives first. During the game the player that's winning will have
their shovel painted green while the one thats losing will have it painted red.
